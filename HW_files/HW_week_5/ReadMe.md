To set up the conda environment needed for HW5, please run the following:
	conda env create -f hw5_env.yml

To activate the environment, run:\n
	conda activate hw5

If creating the environment above fails, please try the following:
	sh create_and_activate_hw5_env.sh
Note: this command will activate the installed environment


Using the python script in hw5.py, this homework walks through fitting a supervised classification model using scikit-learn. We will be using the K-Nearest Neighbors classifier for this task (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html). Please fill in any sections marked "FillMe". For an example of how to run the steps required to fit a supervised model using scikit-learn, please view regression_example.html.
