This directory contains five question entitled q1.py, q2.py, q3.py, q4.py, and q5.py.
Each question has multiple parts, and involve implementing functions that process data and create plots.

There are test cases for some of the earlier questions' data processing portions.
These test cases are stored in test.py, and will be run automatically when you run the code for that question.

As it is not possible to write test cases for visualization, correct versions of the visualizations can be found
in the folder 'TA_viz'.
I recommend that you not look at the visualizations for question 1 before completing it though, it will ruin some of the fun.

As always, if you have any questions, feel free to ask on Piazza or during office hours.
Good luck, and have fun!
